# modular_aquarium_divider

Maybe the ugliest aquarium divider in the world.

It's modular. Tile size is 105 x 105 mm. Frame width - 16 mm. Holders designed for 3.8 mm glass. With 2x2 tiles it's size is 242 x 242 mm.

No glue or any additional parts required to assemble this therefore fits are made to be tight.
